#Academic Awards Filter (Advanced)

A more advanced version of the existing Academic Awards filter on CommonSpot, this filter is a React application that ustilizes the generated JSON data from the Academic Award element to generate a more powerful listing and filter of the current Award Data. Users can filter by category (multiple supported, through checkboxes), minimum amount and a text filter to match anything in the data that a user types in. The results are also paginated for cleaner and more compact display, especially when a larger number of filter results are returned.
